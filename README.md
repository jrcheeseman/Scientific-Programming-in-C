Project 1 - Write a program that reads in a data file (using fopen) and then calculates and prints out the mean, standard deviation, and standard error.

Project 2 - Write a program that when given a data file will transform the data (by calculating the logarithm of the data; the program should be able to do this for arbitrary log bases, such as log base 3, log base 8, log base 10, etc.) and output new files that are the transformed versions of the old file. The program should read in the desired log base using scanf() from the standard C console.

Project 3 - Write a program that reads in a data file, sorts the numbers into ascending and descending orders, and outputs the sorted numbers into two new files.

Project 4 - Write a program that when given a data file containing columns of x and y values, performs linear regression (using least squares minimization), determines the slope and y-intercept of the best-fitting regression line as well as the Pearson r correlation coefficient.

Project 5 - Write a program that performs a one-way within-subjects Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

Project 6 - Write a program that performs a Kruskal-Wallis one-way Analysis of Variance of Ranks (ANOVA of Ranks).

Project 7 - Write a program that performs a two-way within-subjects Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

Project 8 - Write a graphics program using OpenGL that draws selected portions of the Mandelbrot set (a “fractal”) into a graphics window. Alternatively you can choose to draw Julia sets if you prefer.

Project 9 - Write a graphics OpenGL program that draws a random-dot stereogram of a curved surface portrayed as an anaglyph (i.e., can be viewed with red/green glasses).

Project 10 - Write a graphics OpenGL program that depicts a 3-D object using the kinetic depth effect.
